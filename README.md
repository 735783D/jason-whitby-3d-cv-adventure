This project was done using the walkthrough by JSMastery on Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkowOdMjvYo). I customized it to fit my background and personal
aesthics. The song on the Home page was is a royalty free song I downloaded from Pixabay called "Creepy Halloween". That can be found [here](https://pixabay.com/music/scary-childrens-tunes-creepy-halloween-250076/)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
